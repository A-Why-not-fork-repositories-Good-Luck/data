Centralization of source data for Airframes.io projects.

# Non-Commercial Licensing

Use of the data here for your **non-commercial** projects is **allowed & encouraged**. There is no cost to you. We only require that a small attribution is made to help reinforce awareness of our efforts and to encourage others to submit improvements (which in turn benefits you). Republishing the data and representing it as your own is prohibited, as it undercuts the significant amount of effort we continue to put into this.

Shoot us a note to let us know that you're using it at [licensing@airframes.io](mailto:licensing@airframes.io) so that we can tell others about your cool project, or update you if there are going to be significant changes to the structure of data.

If you find these resources useful, you may also consider [contributing to our data project funds](https://buy.stripe.com/aEU5m42QLdWI67mcMP). This is optional for non-commercial uses, but thank you for any contributions.

# Commercial Licensing

Use of the data here for your **commercial** projects **is not allowed without financial compensation**. We have put significant resources into gathering, publishing, updating, curating, and otherwise creating for our own projects that it is expected that commercial projects must pay for licensing.

You may [purchase an annual license](https://buy.stripe.com/9AQ01K1MH8CoanCeUY) for this data for your commercial effort. If you need more information, please contact [licensing@airframes.io](mailto:licensing@airframes.io). Each annual license entitles the entity/project to be listed here, but are not by default. If you wish to be listed [email after payment](mailto:licensing@airframes.io) and include the name and description to be shown. Being listed can show your support for our effort and bring potential interest to your product.
