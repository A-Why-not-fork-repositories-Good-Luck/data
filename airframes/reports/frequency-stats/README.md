# Airframes Frequency Stats by Region

From time to time [Airframes](https://airframes.io) will run a report to look at the summation of frequencies used regionally as received by the Airframes ingests from user decoder stations.

This information can be used to tune which frequencies are used and listened on in order to decode in your region since it highlights which ones others users are successful with.
